# Lucky Robots Virtual Training Environment

Lucky Robots: Where robots come for a boot camp, like going to a spa day! ü§ñüíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We use the fancy Unreal Engine 5.2, Open3D and YoloV8 to create a lavish, virtual 5-star resort experience for our metal buddies so they're absolutely pumped before they meet the real world. Our training framework? More like a robotic paradise with zero robot mishaps. "Gentle" methods? We're practically the robot whisperers here, you won't see humans with metal sticks around. That's why it's "Lucky Robots" because every robot leaves our sessions feeling like they just won the jackpot ‚Äì all without a scratch! üé∞ü§£ 

Remember, no robots were emotionally or physically harmed in our ultra-luxurious training process. 

Cheers to happy, and more importantly, unbruised robots! üçÄü§ñüéâ

## Features

1. **Realistic Training Environments**: Train your robots in various scenarios and terrains crafted meticulously in Unreal Engine.
2. **Python Integration**: The framework integrates seamlessly with Python 3.10, enabling developers to write training algorithms and robot control scripts in Python.
3. **Safety First**: No physical wear and tear on robots during training. Virtual training ensures that our robotic friends remain in tip-top condition.
4. **Modular Design**: Easily extend and modify the framework to suit your specific requirements or add new training environments.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5.2
- Python 3.10
- Modern GPU and CPU for optimal performance

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucky-robots/lucky-robots.git
   cd lucky-robots
   ```

2. **Setup Python Environment**

   Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_lucky_robots
   . venv_lucky_robots/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Setup Local Redis with Docker**
   ```bash
   cd redis
   docker pull redis
   docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
   ```
4. **Launch Unreal Project**

   Open the provided `.uproject` file in Unreal Engine 5.2 and let it compile the necessary assets and plugins.

5. **Connect Python Script**

   Modify the `config.py` file with the appropriate paths and settings for your setup.

## Usage

1. **Start Unreal Simulation**

   Launch the Unreal Project and play the simulation scenario you wish to train your robot in.

2. **Run Python Training Script**

   With the simulation running, execute your Python script to interface with the Unreal simulation and start training your robot.

   ```bash
   python train_robot.py
   ```
