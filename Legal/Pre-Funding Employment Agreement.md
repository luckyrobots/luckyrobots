** PREAMBLE TO THE AGREEMENT ** 

Lucky Robots aims to become a transparent, open-source company that will provide free software to developers and will seek to be profitable in the long run by providing commercial license as well. It will raise funds in the future, but for the time being, it's founder (me/Devrim) is financing our journey from his savings.

For those who are joining us in these early stages, here's how I'm recognizing your valuable contributions: Let's use an example for clarity. Imagine your standard hourly rate is $100. However, you decide to support our vision and work for $50/hr for a total of 1,000 hours. In this scenario, you'd have been paid $50k and have provided an additional $50k worth of value to Lucky Robots. When we secure our future funding, here's my commitment to you: I can either compensate you with 150% of that deferred $50k (amounting to $75,000) in cash, or if you prefer an equity route, I'd offer 250% (which is $125,000) in preferred stock.

In light of this, I have a few guidelines and expectations:

1. **Billable Contributions**: I'd like every creative contribution to be in 4-hour blocks. Only contributions that meet this criteria will be deemed billable (exceptions apply).
  
2. **Remote and Async-Friendly Work**: I'm big on remote and async-friendly work. Please ensure you report your work on the same day it's completed and not any later.
   
3. **Billing Etiquette**: Social minutes or casual interactions shouldn't appear on the bill. However, I encourage you to have these moments—connecting with the team is essential. Let's try to keep them reasonable.
